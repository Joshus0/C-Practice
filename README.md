# C Programming Practice 🖥️

This repository documents my learning journey with the **C programming language**.
It contains various exercises and small programs designed to understand low-level concepts and memory handling.

## 📂 Content Overview
The codebase covers the following topics:
* **Basics:** Data types, control flow, and functions.
* **Arrays & Strings:** Manual string manipulation and buffer handling.
* **Pointers:** Memory addresses, dereferencing, and pointer arithmetic.
* **Algorithms:** Custom implementations of standard library functions (e.g., `strlen`, array reversal).

## 🚀 Goal
The main objective is to master memory management and understand how software interacts with hardware "under the hood."
